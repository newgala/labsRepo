![alt text](https://github.com/newgala/IronAngela/blob/main/stroke%20pic.jpg)
### Data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/general/248836)

### Objective:
Predicting strokes incidences using the logistic regression classify and check the result accurancy 
***
### Built with:
 [Python](https://www.python.org/)
1. Initial cleaning steps
2. EDA
3. Pre-processing
4. Train, test, split
5. Logistic regression classify
6. Check accuracy of our classification model
7. Resampling techniques
8. Correlating categories
9. AUC 

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* Data aggregations and visualisations of which variable have more impact on the incidence rate and we found out that the age and the BMI are highly correlated to the incidence of strokes.
