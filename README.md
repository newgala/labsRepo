![alt text](https://github.com/newgala/IronAngela/blob/main/stroke%20pic.jpg)
### Data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/general/248836)

### Objective:
Predicting strokes incidences using the logistic regression classify and check the result accurancy 
***
### Built with:
 [Python](https://www.python.org/)
1. Initial cleaning steps
2. EDA
3. Pre-processing
4. Train, test, split
5. Logistic regression classify
7. Check accuracy of our classification model
8. Resampling techniques:
* confusion_matrix
* heatmap
10. Correlating categories:Random Under Sampler
11. AUC 

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* Data aggregations and visualisations of which variable have more impact on the incidence rate and we found out that the age and the BMI are highly correlated to the incidence of strokes.

### Method:


### Insight

1. Our model can predict a customer accepting or declining the credit card offer with an accuracy of 84%
2. We suspect the following features to impact the customers decision to accept the most:

    mailer type
    credit rating
    income level
    reward
