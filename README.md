# Ironhack group project: working with messy data
### Data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/general/248836)

### About the project:
Predicting strokes incidences
***
### Objective:
Our main challenge will be to use Python to clean, wrangle and generally reshape the data to make it more straightforward to analyse with Python or to visualise with Tableau to plot the data.
***
### Built with:
 [Python](https://www.python.org/)
1. Initial cleaning steps
2. EDA:
Pre-processing
4. Train, test, split
5. Logistic regression classify
6.  Check accuracy of our classification model
7.Resampling techniques
* 
* Counting true values to define subtotals

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* Data aggregations and visualisations of which variable have more impact on the incidence rate
*
* 
***
#### Following some visualisation with Tableau showing:
* top 5 States and cities with the most job opportunities
* top 3 talents the employer are looking for 
* top 3 skills, tools, education the employer wants in the ideal data scientist

### Insight
We found challenging to properly filter the keywords in the dataset, so our findings can be improved.
