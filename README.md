# Ironhack group project: working with messy data
### Team: [Josep](https://github.com/newgala) , [Lam](https://github.com/newgala) and [Angela](https://github.com/newgala)
### Data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sl6149/data-scientist-job-market-in-the-us?select=alldata.csv)

### About the project:
We will be working with a data set scraped from the web about US data science hires in 2018.
<https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/who-gets-hired-an-outlook-of-the-u-s-data-scientist-job-market-in-2018/>
The author wanted to look at some specific questions :
* Who gets hired? What kind of talent do employers want when they are hiring a data scientist?
* Which location has the most opportunities?
* What skills, tools, degrees or majors do employers want the most for data scientists?
***
### Objective:
Our main challenge will be to use Python to clean, wrangle and generally reshape the data to make it more straightforward to analyse with Python or to visualise with Tableau to plot the data.
***
### Built with:
 [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* Standardise and clean the data using string functions,
* Apply map and for loops to check the True and False values for the defined keywords
* Counting true values to define subtotals.
* 
[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
* Data aggregations and visualisations
